# Keep it Alive LD46

An attempt at an entry to Ludum Dare #46. As usual, just a few hours
available to do something, but at least I cleaned up some old Typescript
gamedev bits I had.

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

Build with `npm run watch`.

To get proper source maps in the browser, serve the repo folder, for example
`python -m http.serve 8080` then navigate to `http://localhost:8080/dist`.
