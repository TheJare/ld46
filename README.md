# Keep it Alive LD46

Move your little white ball and stay alive as long as you can. Things hurt you
if you touch them, and you also take damage if you move too long without recovering.

You can play the game at http://iguanademos.com/Jare/games/ld46/

## Details

An attempt at an entry to Ludum Dare #46. As usual, just a few hours
available to do something, but at least I cleaned up some old Typescript
gamedev bits I had.

As usualy, I tweeted my original design shortly after waking up and reading about the topic, **Keep it Alive**:

- reach the goal keeping a candle alive, avoiding drops or buckets of water thrown at you.
You also need to be careful how you move or the wind puts out the flame, but too slow and wax runs out.
- If I try this, my worst enemy will be spending way too long on the flame and / or water simulation
and rendering. On the other hand it may prove a nice bullethell-like experience.
- Touch controls. hold: candle moves slow to you. Drag: candle mimics with dash, reduces flame power
- Plot twist: when you reach the goal, you realize you're a pyromaniac and people were just trying to
stop you from burning a forest. Now go, play the next round and see what you will try to burn this time!

Right now things are spiritually similar to the tweet, but:

- There's no wax (fuel, really) no stages, and no plot twist. It's endless.
- Visuals are as basic as it gets: squares and circles. I draw two bars at the top showing your flame
strength (which peters out as you move) and your health.
- Multiple types of hazards.
- Simple controls. This is really about control and precision.
